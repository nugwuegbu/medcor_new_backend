- Standard REST API design that works with any backend language
- Database abstraction layer using PostgreSQL (portable to any language)
- Component-based frontend architecture
- API-first approach for all integrations
- Standard authentication patterns (JWT, OAuth)
- External service integrations remain language-agnostic

Potential conversion targets: Python (Django/FastAPI), Go, Java (Spring Boot), C# (ASP.NET Core), PHP (Laravel), Ruby (Rails)
