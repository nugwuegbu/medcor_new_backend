- `NODE_ENV`: Environment flag for development/production modes

## Face Recognition Login Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. **Initial Login**: Users first authenticate via OAuth providers (Google, Apple, Facebook)
2. **Phone Number Collection**: New users are prompted to provide phone number for appointment reminders
3. **Face Registration**: After OAuth login, users can register their face for future quick access
4. **Face Recognition Login**: Returning users can login instantly using face recognition

### Technical Implementation
- **OAuth Providers**: Google OAuth2 with passport.js (Apple & Facebook ready for integration)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **Face Recognition**: Azure Face API integration for secure biometric authentication
- **User Management**: Extended user schema with OAuth and face recognition fields
