CRITICAL VIDEO PLAYER ISSUE ANALYSIS

Problem: adana01 loop video continues playing when mode should switch to "heygen" - HeyGen avatar never activates properly.

Current State:
- Session ID: ${problemData.sessionId}
- Mode: ${problemData.mode}
- Video URL: ${problemData.videoUrl}
- Is Playing: ${problemData.isPlaying}

Debug Logs:
${problemData.logs.join('\n')}

ANALYSIS CRITERIA (Score 0-100):
1. Video Element Control (25 points): Does the solution properly pause/stop the video element?
2. State Management (25 points): Does it prevent state conflicts between loop and heygen modes?
3. Session Isolation (25 points): Does it handle multiple session IDs properly?
4. React Re-rendering (25 points): Does it prevent unnecessary component re-mounts?

REQUIRED ANALYSIS:
1. Root cause identification with exact line/function causing the issue
2. Specific code changes needed with exact file paths
3. Testing strategy to verify the fix
4. Score breakdown for each criterion (must achieve 99+ total)

Respond in JSON format:

  "rootCause": "exact root cause with file/line reference",
  "solution": "step-by-step solution",
