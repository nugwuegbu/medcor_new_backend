# MedCor AI Voice Chat Features Documentation

## Overview
The MedCor AI chatbot supports comprehensive voice commands for all major features with stateful conversation management.

3. **User:** "I want to see Dr. Johnson"

4. **User:** "I have a headache"
   - **System:** Records symptoms and confirms appointment

The system maintains context throughout the conversation and automatically fills forms based on voice input.

- `VOICE_FLOW:APPOINTMENT_DATE` - Handles date selection
